## 1. Design a Windows application named Wallpaper App to calculate the number of single rolls of wallpaper required to cover a room.
### 2. Create an interface as shown in Figure 1. There are four combo boxes having a drop down style. Display the range of values for the room’s length, width and height from 10 to 35 in the combo boxes while the value in the combo box for the roll coverage should range from 40 to 50 with an increment of 0.5.
### 3. The calculate button’s click event procedure should calculate and display the number of single rolls of wallpaper required to cover a room. Use a Sub procedure to make the calculation. The number of the single roll should be displayed as an integer. (i.e the number of single roll having a decimal point should be rounded off to the next highest integer).
### 4. The number of roll should be cleared when changes are made on any of the combo boxes.
### 5. Save and test the application. (For example, if the roll coverage is 45.5 sqrFt and the length, width and height of the room are 15, 18 and 20 respectively, the number of single roll will be 30).
